# Windows UI

This repo contains the same game (Nine Men's Morris) built in three different Windows UI frameworks, in an effort to learn more about native Windows UI App development:

- Windows Forms
- WPF
- MAUI

The moral of the story is: Do not develop native Windows UI apps. Try literally anything else. Don't waste your time on these frameworks.
